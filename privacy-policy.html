          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            We use your personal data for a variety of reasons and based on
            different legal basis. <br /><br />
            Collecting personal data based on consent: <br /><br />
            We may use your personal data to send you marketing communication
            which you requested. These may include information about our
            products and services, events, activities and promotions of our
            associated partners’ products or services. This communication is
            subscription based and requires your consent. The collection of
            personal data is based on consent, the data subject will give
            his/her consent by using “Consent Forms” that will store
            documentation related to the consent given by the individual.
            Individual consent will always be stored and documented in our
            system. If you have given consent to the processing of your personal
            data, you can always withdraw the consent by sending the e-mail to
            the e- mail address given below in the contact details (see “How to
            contact us” below). Withdrawal of consent does not affect the
            admissibility of processing before the withdrawal. In case of
            withdrawal of consent, we will not process your data, unless we have
            legal obligation for processing. We will respond to each request as
            soon as possible, and in any case no later than within 30 days of
            receiving the request. <br /><br />
            Collecting personal data based on contractual necessity:
            <br /><br />
            We use your personal data for fulfilling our contractual obligations
            towards you. It is impossible for us to perform our service to you
            without collecting and processing your personal data (contractual
            necessity as legal basis). Examples of contractual necessity as
            legal basis for your personal data collection and processing are
            opening an account with us, processing and/or initiating payment
            transactions using our services, receiving settlements from us,
            invoicing, etc. <br /><br />
            Collecting personal data based on legal obligations: <br /><br />
            In some cases we are under legal obligation to process your personal
            data as part of our KYC requirements, preventing, detecting and
            investigating money laundering, terrorist financing and fraud
            prevention, sanction screening, reporting to tax authority, police
            authorities, supervisory authorities, payment service requirements.
            <br /><br />
            We may also send you information about the products and services
            that you have purchased from us, and replies to a “Contact me” or
            other web forms you have completed on our website. We will follow up
            on incoming requests (customer support, emails, chats or phone
            calls). We will notify you of every disruption to our services
            (system messages).
            <br /><br />
            We also have a legitimate interest to use profiling when monitoring
            transactions in order to detect fraudulent transactions. Profiling
            is any form of automated processing of personal data in the form of
            analysis and assessment of specific aspects. Based on that analysis,
            some cases of atypical behavior can be established, which are then
            examined, one by one, in order to determine whether fraudulent
            transactions exists or not.
            <br /><br />
            Please keep in mind that We will not be able to provide our services
            to you in case you fail to provide the necessary personal data as
            described in this Privacy Policy.

            additional generally accepted industry standards. Where we have

            California: <br /><br />
            If you are a consumer from California, this Privacy Policy for
            California (CA Privacy Policy) is designed to help you understand
            the categories of personal data we collect about you, where we
            obtain this personal data, why we process it, with whom we share it,
            and the rights you must know and control your personal data. If this
            CA Privacy Policy and any provision in the rest of our Privacy

            Information on Collection: <br /><br />
            For the purposes of CCPA, the Company generally acts as a "business"
            regarding your personal data. A business is similar to a data
            controller, meaning that the Company determines how and why it
            handles personal data collected from or about you. This Information
            on Collection of Personal Data describes our practice of collecting
            personal data when we act as a business, including a list of
            categories of personal data we collect, the purposes for which we
            collect personal data, and the sources from which we collect
            personal data. CCPA requires from the Company to make certain
            disclosures using the categories of personal data used in the CCPA
            definition of personal data. <br /><br />

            use of this data to perform the service you requested is in
            accordance with permissible business purposes in the California
